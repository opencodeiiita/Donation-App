## How To Contibute

We welcome your contributions. Please follow the below guidelines while contributing to this project:

1. Fork and star⭐ the repository and clone locally.
2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before your branch. See detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)
3. Do the work and commit changes with good commit messages.
4. Once you are confident in your work, create a pull request to the `master` branch of the upstream repository with proper descriptions explaining what you did and wait until we review it😊.

> Check out [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for more details.

 🧷**Directly cloning from Android Studio (Alternate method):-**

- Go to FILE ➡️ NEW ➡️ PROJECT FROM VERSION CONTROL.
- Copy and paste the url of **FORKED repo** in the URL field and click clone.

## 🧾Common Rules:
- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific issues.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points🎉 will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, code architecture etc.
- These tasks are for learning and not just scoring points so any kind of Plagiarism or attempt thereof wouldn't be tolerated and would lead to disqualification from OpenCode.
- **Your code should be error-free before creating a pull request.**

> ALL THE FINAL DECISIONS FOR THE JUDGMENT AND AWARDING OF POINTS ⚖️ BASED ON THE SUBMISSION RESIDE WITH THE MENTORS & ORGANISERS. No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors & Organisers🙂.

## 🗒️Guidlines 
Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

- Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the pattern given in [PR_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/Donation-app/blob/master/PR_TEMPLATE.md)

- Provide the relevant screenshot for easier review.

- Pull Request older than 2 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.
